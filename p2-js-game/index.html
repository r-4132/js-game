<!-- I forgot to mention during presentation tha I should have utilized javascript because I got too focused on 
    trying to build the foundation of my game dev skills. I forgot the main object of the project. Although the game is made with javascript. 
    I felt like I should have implemented it better. Also I thought that if I finish earlier, I would work on my code wars. unfortunately , 
    that was not the case because I got really busy this week and specially with the long weekends.  -->
